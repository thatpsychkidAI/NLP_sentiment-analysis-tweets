# COVID-19 Sentiment Analysis on Twitter

# Description: 
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on tweets related to COVID-19 using Natural Language Processing techniques in Python.

# Dataset: 
The dataset used in this project is the COVID-19 Twitter dataset available on Kaggle, which contains tweets related to COVID-19 from January to July 2020. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid19-tweets

# Process:
1.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The first step in this project is to clean and preprocess the dataset using Python libraries such as NLTK and Pandas. This involves removing stop words, stemming or lemmatizing the text, and converting the text to lowercase.
2. Sentiment Analysis: Next, we will perform sentiment analysis on the preprocessed data using Python libraries such as NLTK and TextBlob. We will classify the tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on their sentiment scores.
3. Visualization: Finally, we will visualize the sentiment analysis results using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain insights into the overall sentiment of the tweets.

# Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the use of Natural Language Processing techniques to perform sentiment analysis on tweets related to COVID-19. The insights gained from this analysis can be useful for understanding public sentiment and informing decision making.

# Documentation:
The entire project, including the code, analysis, and results, will be documented in a clear and organized manner, including comments and annotations to explain the thought process and reasoning behind each step. This documentation will be published on a public repository on Github for others to view and use.
